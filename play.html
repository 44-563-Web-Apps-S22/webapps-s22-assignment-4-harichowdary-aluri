    <h6>ACT I</h6>
    <p><h6>SCENE I</h6>Madame Pernelle and her servant Flipote, Elmire, Mariane, Dorine, Damis, Cleante</p>
    
    <p><h6>Mme</h6>:Pernelle.  Let's go, Flipote, let's go.  I hate this place.</p>
    <h6>Elmire</h6>
    <p> I can't keep up, you rush at such a pace.</p>
    <h6>Mme</h6>
    <p>Pernelle.  Peace, my dear, peace; come no farther.<br>
        I don't wish to cause you any bother.</p>
    <h6>Elmire</h6>
    <p> What duty demands, I insist on giving.<br>
        But, mother, what has caused your hasty leaving?</p>
    <h6>Mme</h6>
    <p>Pernelle.  I just can't stand the way your household runs . . .<br>
        And no one cares what I wish to have done.<br>
        Oh, yes, I leave your household quite dissatisfied<br>
        For all my wise advice has been defied . . .<br>
        And nobody respects me, and everybody shouts,<br>
        And truly this is a home for the king of louts!</p>
    <h6>Dorine</h6>
    <p>If . . .</p>
    <h6>Mme</h6>
    <p>Pernelle.   You, my dearie, are a bold lassy,<br>
        A little brazen and very sassy,<br>
        You butt into everything to speak your mind.</p>
       <h6> Damis</h6> 
       <P>  But . . .</P>
        <h6>Mme.</h6>
        <p>Pernelle.    You, grandson, are a fool of the worst kind.<br>
                It is I, your grandmother, that pronounce this edict<br>
                And to my son, your father, I have oft predicted<br>
                That you'll turn out to be a worthless wastrel,<br>
                And give him in life a foretaste of Hell.</p>
        <h6>Mariane.</h6>
        <p>I think . . .</p>  
        <h6>Mme.</h6>
        <p> Pernelle.     My lord, his sister!  You seem so discreet<br>
                And so untainted, so very sweet,<br>
                But the stillest waters are filled with scum,<br>
                And your sly ways earn my revulsion.</p>
        <h6>Elmire.</h6> 
        <p> But . . .</p>
        <h6>Mme. Pernelle.  </h6>
           <p>Daughter, my views may make you mad,<br>
                But your conduct in all things is all bad.<br>
                In your family's eyes you should be an example-setter;<br>
                In that respect their late mother did far better.<br>
                You are extravagant, and it wounds me, I guess,<br>
                To see you sashay about dressed like a princess.<br>
                A woman who wishes only to please her mate,<br>
                Dear daughter, need not primp and undulate.</p>
